# MySeniorProject
Water Quality Monitoring System Native Mobile Application.
This was a mobile application created by myself and my group for our IOT embedded system, This was our Senior Design Project.
This app was created using Dart; the programming language of Flutter, to help us interact with our system in a smarter way,
to have access to sensor output data and more, and to also control componants like the water pump used in the system.
